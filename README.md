# ObjParser
Small, custom Application built entirely with Java. Has a front-end GUI to process 3D files of type .obj. It parses vertex positions based on triangulated face data, and exports a list of unified geometrical vertex positions.

E.g. usable for a triangle mesh in Bullet Physics.

#### Current Functions:
- Select one or multiple files to batch process
- Processes only files of type .obj

# Requirements
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment) V20 or later
- Windows 11

## Optional
- Eclipse IDE for Java
